<h1>Self-Service MetaDL</h1>
<h3>Brought to you by ChaLearn and Microsoft</h3>
<p>This self-service pseudo-competition aims to quickly evaluate meta-learning 
    approaches effective in the few-shot learning setting for image 
    classification tasks, on the submitted dataset. More details are available
    in the Evaluation and Data tabs.
</p>

<p>
    Participants need to train a meta-learner on a meta-train set and produce 
    a learner (a machine learning algorithm), which will be used to 
    train on classification tasks generated from the meta-test set and evaluated.
    A participant's submission will be evaluated by the capacity of this learner
    to quickly adapt to new unseen tasks. Please refer to the evaluation section 
    for more details.
